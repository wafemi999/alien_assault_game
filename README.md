# My First Python Project

Runs on any  python 3 version
just launch or run the alien_assault file
 Alien assault, a simple shooting game where the player controls a ship that appears at
the bottom center of the screen. The player  moves the ship
 using right and left arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. 
If the player shoots all the aliens, a new group of aliens
appears that moves faster than the previous group also if any alien hits
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
