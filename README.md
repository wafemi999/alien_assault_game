 Alien assault, a simple shooting game where the player controls a ship that appears at
the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
 using right and left arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, groups of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new group of aliens
appears that moves faster than the previous group If any alien hits
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
